This is a little fork of the polyMC launcher, see [here](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC) for the original repo.
This fork just remove the error message when you are adding an offline account without a microsoft account.

**I do not support hacking or piracy but I personnaly prefer on some device paying MC without login.**

this fork was tested on :
- Windows (10/11)

I will probably also test it on linux but not on mac os because i don't own one (and btw why are you using a mac, switch to windows or linux and end your suffering. ðŸ˜€)
